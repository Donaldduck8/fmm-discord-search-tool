# fmm-discord-search-tool

A small Python script to help exclude songs by duration on Soundcloud and Bandcamp. The tool first searches your query exhaustively (limited to 8000 results on Soundcloud and 500 results on Bandcamp by the API), then searches by duration locally.

Please note: Sometimes the Soundcloud client ID may expire. I'll try to find a way around this
